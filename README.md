# ARC-DinoV2: Solving the ARC-AGI Challenge

This project tackles the ARC-AGI challenge by framing it as a classification problem. The approach leverages the power of the DinoV2 model.

- **Input Representation**: Each input is transformed into a 224x224 image.
- **Output Format**: The model outputs a 3D cube with dimensions 11x30x30, representing the symbols.

More detailed information will be added soon.
